    "### Introduction\n",
    "Hello everyone, I am a data scientist that enthusatic on software development. The motivation of setting up my website is that I want to share my experiences and make my profolio more representative. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here I use Github and Hexo to setup the website. The advantages of them are:\n",
    "+ The domain is free and the websites are deployed on cloud, so we don't need to buy any hardware (e.g. NAS, router, PC, server) that can't shutdown.\n",
    "+ It supports Markdown, easy to learn and commonly used language. See more at [Learning Markdown in 10 minutes](https://bnbsking.github.io/2021/01/17/Untitled/)\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, there are some limits, such as:\n",
    "+ The website is static. It doesn't support animations such as javascript.\n",
    "+ There is no backend so that one cannot upload or download data.\n",
    "+ The size of website are limited less than 1 GB  \n",
    "+ The bandwidth cannot exceed 100GB per month\n",
    "+ The submit times have a soft limit of 10 per hour\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it's very enough for most of the user for sharing their techniques or displaying their works. Now, we move to the tutorial for creating your first website. (This article is for the\n",
    "Windows10 user only). This tutorial is referenced by [[教學] 使用 GitHub Pages + Hexo 來架設個人部落格](https://ed521.github.io/2019/07/hexo-install/)\n",

    "### Setup\n",
    "1. Sign in or Sign up your github account at [Github](https://github.com/).\n",
    "2. Create a new repository with the name <font color=#0000FF>your_account_name</font>.github.io\n",
    "3. Visit the repository and click \"setting\", then click \"Choose a theme\". No matter what theme is chosen, it will be replaced by hexo themes later.\n",
    "4. Install the software, including:\n",
    "    1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (14.15.4 is feasible)\n",
    "    2. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (2.30.0 is feasible)\n",
    "    3. [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) (7.8.x is feasible)\n",
    "5. Open the CMD and type the following commands. Note that <font color=#0000FF>your_installation_path</font> and the <font color=#0000FF>your_blog_name</font> can be set as you want.\n",
    "```\n",
    "npm install -g hexo-cli\n",
    "cd your_installation_path\n",
    "hexo init your_blog_name\n",
    "cd your_blog_name\n",
    "npm install\n",
    "npm install hexo-deployer-git --save\n",
    "npm install hexo-admin --save\n",
    "```    \n",
    "Further explanation:\n",
    "    + \"npm\" is a package manager for node.js that widely used in web development under .NET framework\n",
    "    + \"cd\" stands for change directory, the most important and frequently used command in both windows and linux.\n",
    "    + These command is to install the tools that available for us to clean the cache, deploy new website and manage the web in just one line command. The other thing is to initialize our blog with your_blog_name. You can see a directory with many files in <font color=#0000FF>your_installation_path</font>.\n",
    "![123]('.png')\n",
    "6. Edit the text file <font>_config.yml</font> in <font color=#0000FF>your_installation_path</font>.\n",
    "    + You can set the title, subtitle, author at this file\n",
    "    + Then set the url as https://<font color=#0000FF>your_github_account</font>.github.io/\n",
    "    + Finally, go to the bottom part of the file, and set the repo as https://github.com/<font color=#0000FF>your_github_account</font>/<font color=#0000FF>your_github_account</font>.github.io.git\n",
    "7. Now, we can deploy our website. There will be a example article as the first deployment. The following commands are both suitable for first deployment and all the deployment later.\n",
    "```\n",
    "hexo cl\n",
    "hexo g\n",
    "hexo d\n",
    "```\n",
    "The three steps stands for clean, generate and deploy. You can also type the full name instead of the abbreviation. Finally, we can vist our website https://<font color=#0000FF>your_github_account</font>.github.io .\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create your first post\n",
    "Now, let's start to post our first article and deploy it.\n",
    "1. Stay at the same directory, or `cd your_installation_path` if needed, and launch the server\n",
    "```\n",
